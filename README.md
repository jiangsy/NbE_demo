# Formalization of Normalization by Evaluation of System T

This repo formalizes the normalization of evaluation of System T (STLC + Nat + Recursion) in Coq, including totality, soundness and completeness. The proof follows "Normalization by Evaluation: Dependent Typs and Impredicativity". The machanization is based on those in https://github.com/HuStmpHrrr/mech-type-theories which were written in Agda.

## Usage 

```
make
```

The proof of System T is in `./systemt/`. 

`./ptt/` contains unfinished work for a extending System T to a dependently typed system. Since its corresponding Agda formalization requires induction-recursion which is not currently supported by Coq, it may remain unfinished for a long time (there is a workaround to rely on the impredicativity of `Prop` in Coq, as shown in A "Coq Formalization of Normalization by Evaluation for Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory")

`./stlc/` contains unfinished work for replacing explicit substitutions with substitution-as-operations.
